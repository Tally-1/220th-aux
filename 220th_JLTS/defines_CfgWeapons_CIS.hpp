 *	Base class definitions of droid gear items in JLTS - TGW for modders who wish make armor textures dependent on JLTS - TGW
 *	The list is incomplete, only contains classes of items that are actually useful for re-texturing
 *	
 *	Way to utilize this file:
 *		Put this file in the folder where your config.cpp is located and do this
 *		
 *		class CfgWeapons {
 *			#include "CfgWeaponsDefinitions.hpp"
 *			....
 *		};
