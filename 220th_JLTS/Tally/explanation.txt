HOW UNIFORMS WORK:

Every uniform consists of 2 config-parts

1) An inventory config, registered in CFG weapons the same as any other inventory item.
2) A unit config, registered in CFG vehicles as a unit/man.

The inventory config only serves to set an inventory image and link to the unit config.
The unit config is where you set armor values, textures and any other stuff you want to add.


for the purpose of keeping thing organized and easy to tweak I have organized the uniforms in the following structure.

[UNIFORMS]
    -items.hpp  (A list including all item.hpp  files listed in the uniform folders)
    -models.hpp (A list including all model.hpp files listed in the uniform folders)

    [UNIFORM FOLDERS]
        -item.hpp 
        -model.hpp 

HOW TO UPDATE TEXTURES:
1) Copy a folder from uniforms and copy it there.
2) Change the classNames to become unique.
3) Make sure items.hpp and model.hpp are linking to eachother
4) Copy the path to the texture you want to use
5) Set armor values (optional)

6) Enjoy!
